## Introduction

The Restaurant Rating Prediction project aims to use machine learning to predict the ratings of restaurants based on various attributes. Accurate prediction of restaurant ratings can help restaurateurs enhance their services and assist customers in making better dining decisions.

## Project Overview

The project involves several key steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from reliable sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict ratings.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the best model for practical use.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training with multiple algorithms
- Model evaluation and selection
- Model deployment scripts

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Flask/Django (for deployment)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NIKHILnitr/Restaurant_Rating_Prediction.git
    cd Restaurant_Rating_Prediction
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare your data:

```sh
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

### Feature Engineering

Generate features required for model training:

```sh
python src/feature_engineering.py
```

### Model Training

Train the model using the prepared data:

```sh
python src/model_training.py
```

### Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model:

```sh
python src/model_evaluation.py
```



## Model Training

The model training process involves selecting and tuning various machine learning algorithms to achieve the best performance. The training scripts and Jupyter notebooks provided will guide you through this process.

## Evaluation

Model evaluation is conducted to determine the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. The evaluation script uses metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² to assess model performance.
